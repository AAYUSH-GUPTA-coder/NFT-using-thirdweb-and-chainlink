We have build a custom ERC-721 NFT Collection using `Thirdweb` and `Chainlink`. Thirdweb ContractKit is used for the ERC-721 token standard, thirdweb deploy is used to deploy our smart contract to mumbai testnetwork and Chainlink Data feed is used to set base price for minting NFT. Basically we will build and deploy a smart contract that allows user to mint NFT. The user have to pay atleast $1 in Matic to mint the NFT. We get the real price conversion using Chainlink Data Feeds.
